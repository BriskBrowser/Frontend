## Rewards

The Fast Browser project runs a hosted version which is supported by Google Ads and donations.  Project contributors who submit a series of patches which close a bug can receive a share of project revenue, minus Digital Ocean hosting costs, for 6 months after their fix is submitted.

Today these amounts are negligable, but are designed to reward contributors if the project sees success.

Bugs eligible for reward are tagged as such in the bugtracker.  Please beware that to be eligible for a reward, a bug must be closed to the satisfaction of other project contributors.  You are advised to start with small or unrewarded bugs to get a hang of contributing to the project.  Any disputes will be resolved in good faith by project maintainer @Hello1024 (who is herself ineligible for all rewards), and you should consider everything here a guideline rather than a firm rule .

Reward percentages are set by @Hello1024 based on the importance to the project of the bug being fixed and the difficulty of fixing it.  If you spot a bug which you think should be rewarded, or where you think the reward amount is wrong, point it out.


### Mechanics of the reward

Reward recipients will be shown proof of revenue and server costs, and will receive their reward percentage share of those costs.  In the unlikley event more than 100% of rewards are claimed for a given day, rewards will be linearly scaled down.   The reward period begins when a bug is closed for 7 consecutive days, and ends 180 days later.  If a bug has many contributors, @Hello1024 may decide to split the reward based on *code* contributions.

The recipient is responsible for making sure both the project and themselves meet all necessary laws for payment of the reward, and paying any taxes or fees relating to the reward.  The recipient can also elect to donate the reward to another person or charity of their choice.
